## ABOUT ME

As a Ph.D. student I am interested in modeling people's decisions, identifying factors leading to irrational behaviours and ultimately in developing interventions to elicit better outcomes. I work as a research assistant at the [Neuromechanics Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/neuromechanics/) with Dr. Alaa Ahmed in trying to understand how the brain selects durations associated with reaching movements and how it relates with past and future actions. I also work with [Dr. Michael Mozer](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/), who advised me during my M.S. in Electrical Engineering that I obtained in 2017. My masters thesis was focused on developing and solving an optimal control model of people's behaviour in delayed gratification tasks. Between 2015 and 2017, I spent time interning part-time and full-time (in the summers) at Answeron Inc., building models for predicting and preventing subscriber and employee churn for their clients. My duties included building the code base from scratch in python and maintaining it.

<!-- Before coming to Boulder for graduate school, I spent eight years in Chennai, India for high school and my undergraduate degree. My bachelors was in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University. While at CEG, I volunteered at the Integrated Systems Laboratory with Dr. P.V. Ramakrishna learning the basics of CMOS analog design. During my time there, I was able to help out on a variety of projects including building a GNSS transceiver system. My senior year project involved building a speech recognition systems using basic concepts from unsupervised machine learning like clustering and expectation-maximization. This was my first introduction to modeling and studying human behvaiour that ultimately led me to switch fields. -->
