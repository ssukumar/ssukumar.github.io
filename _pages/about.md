## ABOUT ME

As a Ph.D. student I am interested in modeling people's decisions, identifying factors leading to irrational behaviours and ultimately in developing interventions to elicit better outcomes. I work as a research assistant at the [Neuromechanics Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/neuromechanics/) with Dr. Alaa Ahmed in trying to understand how the brain selects durations associated with reaching movements and how it relates with past and future actions. I also work with [Dr. Michael Mozer](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/), who advised me during my M.S. in Electrical Engineering that I obtained in 2017. My masters thesis was focused on developing and solving an optimal control model of people's behaviour in delayed gratification tasks. Between 2015 and 2017, I spent time interning part-time and full-time (in the summers) at Answeron Inc., building models for predicting and preventing subscriber and employee churn for their clients. My duties included building the code base from scratch in python and maintaining it.


## NEWS

* **Apr 2021:** Dispatch article out in Current Biology summarizing new research out of the Sensorimotor Neuroscience Laboratory at Simon Fraser University on how gaze influences step choice during walking on uncertain terrain!
* **Apr 2021:** Presented out foraging and reach vigor work as a [poster](http://ssukumar.github.io/files/NCM_2021_Sukumar_Poster.pdf) at the virtual Neural Control of Movement meeting 2021. Thanks to the organizers for putting together a wonderful virtual meeting. You can also access the video recording of the poster presentation [here](http://ssukumar.github.io/files/NCM_poster_video_Sukumar).
* **Nov 2020:** Presented my foraging and movement work at MLMC'20! [(video link)](https://youtu.be/neCyO5tN754?t=2509). Also checkout the other talks in the link to learn more about exciting motor control research!
* **Oct 2020:** Our work on the link between motor vigor and decision making has also been accepted for a presentation at this year's (virtual) [Motor Learning and Motor Control symposium](http://www.motor-conference.org/openconf.php)!
* **Sept 2020:** Presented my work on [the link between arm reaching effort and decision making during foraging](http://ssukumar.github.io/files/jc_presentation_biomech.pptx) at the Biomechanics Journal Club at CU Boulder.
* **Aug 2020:** Had fun helping attendees with git at the [virtual ASB Version Control Tutorial](https://www.ryan-alcantara.com/projects/p90_Github_Tutorial_for_researchers/) organized by Ryan Alcantara, Gary Bruening and Ross Wilkinson.

<!-- * **May 2020:** Wrapped up TA-ing for undergrad Machine Learning at CU. Thanks to Dr. Kim and all the students for the opportunity.
* **Oct 2019:** Presented my work on [foraging and motor control](http://ssukumar.github.io/files/SFN_foraging_posterv3.pdf) at SFN'19 in Chicago.
* **Aug 2019:** Completed my Ph.D. preliminary exam for computational modelling with a review paper on foraging! Thanks to my committee members Dr. Alaa Ahmed, Dr. Mike Mozer and Dr. Liz Bradley. I also had an opportunity to present my prelims work to Dr. Orit Peleg's group.  
* **July 2019:** Presented preliminary results on foraging work at Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making'19 in Montreal.
* **May 2019:** Had the privilege of attending the wonderful [Optimal Neuroethology of Movement and Motor Control workshop](http://www.birs.ca/events/2019/5-day-workshops/19w5235) at the Banff International Research Station in the breathtaking Canadian Rockies!
* **April 2019:** My [abstract](http://ssukumar.github.io/files/RMASB_final_Shruthi.pdf) was selected for a podium presentation at the annual meeting of the Rocky Mountain chapter for ASB. Our work on the effect of effort on Motor Learning was also presented at the same conference by Humsini Acharya as a poster.
* **Nov 2018:** Attended the Motor Learning and Motor Control symposium in San Diego. -->
