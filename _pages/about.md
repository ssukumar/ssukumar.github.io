### Welcome to my website!

As a Ph.D. student I am interested in modeling people's decisions, identify factors leading to irrational behaviours and ultimately in developing interventions to elicit better outcomes. I work as a research assistant at the [Neuromechanics Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/neuromechanics/) with Dr. Alaa Ahmed trying to understand how the brain selects durations associated with reaching movements and how it relates with past and future actions. I also work with [Dr. Michael Mozer](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/), who advised me during my M.S. in Electrical Engineering that I obtained in 2017. My masters thesis was focused on developing and solving an optimal control model of people's behaviour in delayed gratification tasks.
